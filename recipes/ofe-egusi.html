        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>If you\'re using uncooked meat, clean and boi, with onion, seasoning powder, garlic, seasoning/spices of your choice, salt to taste. Cook until soft, you can fry, or roast a little bit in the oven, or use as it is. Save some of the meat stock. Add the dried shrimps and fish in a bowl of hot water and salt for a few minutes, remove all the dirt, rinse and set and set aside.              
            </li>
            
            <li>Heat oil in a large pan over medium heat and sauté one sliced onion until soft, add half of the ground crayfish and fish (you can use just ground crayfish), iru and fry for a few seconds. Make sure it's not burned or better still add the iru later.
            </li>
            
            <li>In a bowl, add the blended roasted egusi (melon) then add the remaining ground crayfish mixture, grated ½ onion, small quantity of water/stock and combine make sure it\’s thick if you need to add more liquid make sure you don\’t add too much at the same time if you mistakenly add more than you needed then add more egusi to absorb the liquid.
            </li>
            
            <li>Use your fingers to scoop small balls of egusi mixture and add to the frying onion and fry on low heat (if you use high heat it will burn so also is the locust beans) do not stir.
            </li>
            
            <li>After the egusi has absorbed the oil, stir and continue to fry for about 10 minutes stir as you fry to avoid burning fry until you're satisfied, you'll see the difference when it is well fried.
            </li>
            
            <li>While the egusi is frying clean the pepper and blend with the remaining onion to smooth until smooth. When egusi has fried to how you want it, add the blended pepper, cooked diced liver, and the cleaned dried fish and shrimps, add about one cup of meat stock/water combine, cover and cook until fully cooked.
            </li>
            
            <li>Add the meat, season with salt and seasoning powder/cube (be gentle with the seasoning because the meat was already seasoned) combine and continue to cook until the meat absorbs the egusi mixture. While waiting for the meat to absorb the soup, thaw the spinach (if you\’re using frozen) squeeze out the excess water, if you\’re using fresh vegetable, cut and rinse, then drain in a strainer.
            </li>
            
            <li>You'll notice the oil has floated over the egusi soup. It can be eaten as it is or you can continue to add vegetables.
            </li>
           
            <li>Add the vegetable to the egusi mixture, check the seasoning and readjust if necessary. Cook further for about 3 minutes.
            </li>
            
            <li>Serve with your favorite swallow</li>
